    <h2>Question:</h2>
    <p><strong>When would you use a switch statement in your projects?</strong></p>
    <h2>Answer:</h2>
    <p>
      A switch statement is useful when you need to perform different actions based on the value of a single variable or expression. 
      It is more readable and organized than writing multiple if-else statements, especially when dealing with multiple fixed options like days of the week, menu selections, or status codes.
